# RestaurantTracker
Measures how busy restaurants are around your area using user inputted data, and an algorithm to measure estimated wait time. 



Using a Zipcode to Latitude/Longitude database, the program can effectively estimate all zipcodes in a possible radius around the user's current zipcode or location. Then the program can output all restaurants within in the given radius, along with their wait times. 


The wait times are calculated based on the amount of tables at the restaurant, and eral time updated user-data, to measure when users join the wait list, and are taken off the wait list to an available table.

Soon, the program will distinguish the amount of people tables' can possibly seat, which makes the program more realistic (as there is usually less of a wait for a small party than a party of 15 people). 

Currently in development stage, with the algorithm functional. Soon to be converted into JS, and made into a website (hopefully).
